Machine Learning Algorithms with simple training samples.

I like to learn, innovate and share my knowledge to people. So let's begin.

Machine Learning -

Wikipedia says: 

      Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Google says:

      Machine Learning is an Application of artificial Intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from the experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

Siri says: 
      
      Machine Learning - Branch of statistics and computer science, which studies algorithms and architectures that learn from observed facts. Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Alexa says: 
      
      Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Nice explanation from Amazon's Alexa, Apple's SIRI, Google's OK Google.
In between have a doubt. How these software/devices working ???


1 - How this software recognizing my voice and my poor english ??? 


        Ans : Speech recognition and Natural Language Processing.


2 - How this software understanding my question and getting high level accuracy data?


Ans : 

      Do you really think 'what is machine learning?' this question saved in a conditional loop ???!!!!

      Do you really think that this kind of accuracy from Hueristic approach ?
      
      If the firm have huge amount of data do they can process the information and get accurred answer??
      
      Do you think a software can accurate decisions like human beings(Cognitive minds!!) ???
      
      Yes it is possible. That's where Artificial Intelligence coming to play.
      
Under the Umprella of Artificial Intelligence - There are Data science, Data Analytics, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Cognitive science etc.

Data analytics will help to populate the data in readable and usable format.

Data science will analyse the data and try to get a relationship, predictive analysis, prescriptive analysis - helps to process the data effectively and decision making.

Machine Learning will take input from Data scientist and train the data get the accured output/decisions from system.

Machine Learning - 

1 - Supervised learning  - Training the data with past history/ Normal classifiction/categorical data/ Continues data etc.

        Algorithms we are going to work with is : Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Bayes classifier, Linear Regression, K means etc.

2 - Unsupervised learning - Develop learning patterns/model with algorithm. Where neural networks or Deep Learning coming to play.

      Algorithms we are going to work with is : Few Clustoring Algorithms, Few Convolutional Neural network, Diamention Reduction Algorithms etc.

3 - Reinforcement learning - Purely based on experinece and learning from beginning (Cognitive approach).


Packages used : 

                PL - Python 3.5+
                
                Packages - TensorFlow, PyTorch, Sklearn, theano, numpy,NLTK, Textblob, Quand1, pandas, matplotlib, Keras, NeuralNet etc.
                
                And few MLaas from AWS or IBM Bluemix(Watson) and many more.
                
           
                
 Hope you will contribute my efforts..
